# object-oriented-programming
This repository contains my projects written during the academic course at Politecnico di Torino.
I use this repository in order to commit my work, so I can keep track of my modifications during the different project phases, from the initial version provided by professors to the final and correct version which passes all the tests of the JUnit Test, passing through the first complete solution attempt.
